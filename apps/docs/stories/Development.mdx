# Development

This is a guide for setting up development environment for working on ThemelessUI.

The project is organized as a monorepo powered by [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io).

## Pre-requisites

- [git](https://git-scm.com)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (see correct version in `.nvmrc` or use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies

   ```console
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Start the development environment

   ```console
   pnpm run dev
   ```

## Testing, linting and formatting

Tests, linters and formatters can be run for all the packages by running the next commands in the root directory. The same commands can be also used in the package subdirectories.

```
pnpm run test
pnpm run lint
pnpm run format
```

Linters and formatters are also run in a pre-commit hook for all the staged files.

## Conventional Commits

The project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) specification and it's enforced with [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org). The commit message format is important, because changelogs and releases are generated automatically using information provided in the messages.
