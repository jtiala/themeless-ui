# ⬜️ ThemelessUI

ThemelessUI is a React component library, currently in very early development. The main design principles of the library are:

- ⬜️ Comes with very **minimal base theme**
  - Basically just a CSS reset
  - Not quite _headless_ but almost _themeless_
- 🎨 Themeable with **CSS custom properties** (= CSS variables) and by targeting CSS classes
  - Since the styling is done with CSS-not-in-JS, you can easily use any build tools for optimizing your CSS
- ♿️ Fully **accessible**
