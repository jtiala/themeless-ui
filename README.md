ThemelessUI is a yet another React component library, currently in very early development. Check out [the documentation](https://jtiala.github.io/themeless-ui/) and [the example app](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/themeless-ui-example-d6wt46)!

ThemelessUI's approach to styling is something unique (I think?). The main design principles of the library are:

- ‚¨úÔ∏è Comes with very **minimal base theme**
  - Basically just a CSS reset
  - Not quite _headless_ but almost _themeless_
- üé® Themeable with **CSS custom properties** (= CSS variables) and by targeting CSS classes (this is probably gonna void the warranty?)
  - Since the styling is done with CSS-not-in-JS, you can easily use any build tools for optimizing your CSS
- ‚ôøÔ∏è Fully **accessible**
  - At least until you decide to use black text on dark gray background
